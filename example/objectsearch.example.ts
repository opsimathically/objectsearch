  // anywhere, in any object.
  //
  // However, complex paths are unweildly to look at, so in the following

  // will be simple arrays of strings/numbers so you can visualize
  // things easier:
  // e.g.
  //
  //   [ 'hello' ]
  //   [ 'hello', 'there', 'hi' ]
  //
  // It's IMPORTANT to note however, that significant information is lost
  // during the conversion, and some things simply cannot reliably be
  // converted to a simple path (nested maps/sets/symbols etc).  If you
  // need reliable paths, preserve complex paths.  If you want to visualize
  // paths, or are working with very simple objects, it's fine to simplify
